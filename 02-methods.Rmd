# Methods {-}

This study utlised an online survey to collate responses from clinicians who work in one  regional NHS Ambulance Trust. The online survey consisted of a front page explaining the study and contained a link to the participant information sheet. Participants were asked to indicate their consent to participate using an online form prior to commencing the 12 question online survey (Supplementary 1).

## Setting {-}

YAS provides 24-hour emergency and health care services for the county of Yorkshire in the north of England. The county has a population of approximately five million, spread over almost 6000 square miles of varied terrain, included isolated moors and dales, coastline and heavily populated urban areas. In 2018/19 YAS received more than 998,500 emergency calls and responded to 798,968 incidents by either sending clinicians to scene or by providing assessment and advice over the telephone.

## Participants and recruitment {-}

Participants consisted of patients registered with a GP in the Leeds area, who agreed to be referred to the YAS falls pathway. **BIT ABOUT WHAT THE FALLS PATHWAY ENTAILS** YAS staff make around 70–100 falls referral pathways a month in the Leeds area and all referred patients were offered the opportunity to receive a pharmacist-led clinical medication review. 

This study is part of a larger service evaluation of the PREFACES project. When the referral was made by the ambulance crew, the patient was asked for permission for their contact details to be passed onto the research team. Potential participants were invited to take part in the study by post and sent an invitation pack containing a cover letter, information sheet, questionnaire and a stamped addressed envelope.

### Consent 
All participants were considered to have given their informed consent if the questionnaire was completed and posted back to the research study team. Since the questionnaire was completed anonymously, it was not be possible to determine which data belongs to a specific participant and so withdrawal was not possible. This was explained to particpants in the cover letter.


## Statistical analysis {-}

### Sample size calculation {-}

Based on consultation with the study pharmacist, it was anticipated that 35% of patients who have a negative feeling towards their medicines before the review, would feel positive afterwards, and 15% who initially felt positive about their medicines would feel negative after the review. This means that the proportion of discordant pairs is 50%, with an odds ratio of positive emotion to negative emotion following the review of 2.3. To detect this change with an alpha of 5% and a power of 90% using the method outlined by @julious_estimating_1999, we determine that a sample size of 132 participants would be required.

### Primary outcome analysis {-}

The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who express a positive change in emotion relating to how they feel about their medicines, following a pharmacist-led clinical medication review. To determine this, a comparison was made between the proportions of patients who change their emotional state (negative to neutral, neutral to positive, positive to neutral or neutral to negative) before and after the review. The measures were subsequently collapsed into either positive change, in the case of negative to neutral or neutral to positive emotions expressed before and after the review respectively, and negative change, in the case of positive to neutral or neutral to negative emotions expressed before and after the review respectively. A McNemar’s test was undertaken to determine statistical significance.

### Secondary outcome analysis {-}

To identify whether activities that occur as part of a pharmacist-led clinical medication review have an effect on how patients feel about their medicines (the secondary outcome measure), the distribution of patient’s emotion with respect to their medicines, before and after the medication review, using ordinal logistic regression was undertaken. Adjustments were made for age, gender, ethnic group, how the review was undertaken, how patients felt during the review, and whether they received advice or explanation and/or had medicines stopped or modified (altered dose, altered time of administration, or drug exchanged for another). 

We utilised a proportional odds version of the cumulative logit model (also known as proportional odds model) for the analysis [@agresti_analysis_2010], and the assumptions of proportional odds will be determined using the method outlined by @harrell_regression_2001. In the event that these assumptions do not hold, the analysis will proceed using a partial proportions odds model [@peterson_partial_1990].


### Missing data {-}

In the event that returned booklets were only partially completed, all complete responses were included, and a tally kept of missing responses.
