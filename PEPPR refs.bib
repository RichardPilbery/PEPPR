Instead of presenting isolated techniques, this text emphasizes problem solving strategies that address the many issues arising when developing multivariable models using real data and not standard textbook examples. It includes imputation methods for dealing with missing data effectively, methods for dealing with nonlinear relationships and for making the estimation of transformations a formal part of the modeling process, methods for dealing with "too many variables to analyze and not enough observations," and powerful model validation techniques based on the bootstrap. This text realistically deals with model uncertainty and its effects on inference to achieve "safe data mining".},

	abstract = {Background: Clinical medication review (CMR) is a structured and collaborative service aimed at identifying and resolving medication-related problems (MRPs). This is the ﬁrst systematic review of CMR research in Australia.
Objective: To systematically review the processes and outcomes of CMR in community-settings in Australia.
Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Library and the grey literature were searched from 2000 to February 2015. All study designs were considered. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by two investigators.
Results: Nine controlled studies, 34 observational and uncontrolled studies, 11 qualitative studies (focus groups and interviews) and nine survey studies were included. The CMRs resulted in identiﬁcation of MRPs (n ¼ 15 studies, mean 3.6 MPRs per CMR) and improved adherence (n ¼ 3). Reductions in numbers of medications prescribed (n ¼ 3 studies), hospitalizations (n ¼ 3), potentially inappropriate prescribing (n ¼ 3) and costs (n ¼ 6) were demonstrated. Comparisons to a control group, predominately nonrecipients of CMR, were made in eleven of 43 studies. Evidence supports additional models that promote interprofessional collaboration and timely referral following hospital discharge. Qualitative research identiﬁed low awareness of CMR among eligible non-recipients, while beneﬁts were perceived to outweigh barriers to implementation. Underserved populations include indigenous and culturally and linguistically diverse people, recipients of palliative care, those recently discharged from hospital, people with poor medication adherence, those in rural and remote areas, older males, and younger people with long-term, persistent or serious health problems.
Conclusion: The available evidence suggests CMR is beneﬁcial in improving the quality use of medications and health outcomes. However, lack of comparator groups in many observational studies limited the},

	abstract = {Background
There is an increasing drive to measure and so improve patients’ experiences and outcomes of health care. This also applies to medicines, given their ubiquity as health care interventions. Patients’ experiences of using medicines vary, and instruments which measure these are seen as an essential component to improve care. We aimed to identify generic measures of patients’ experiences of using prescription medicines and to examine their properties and suitability for use in research or practice.

Methods
Multiple electronic databases were searched: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, CINHAL Plus, PROQOLID®, and Google Scholar. We identified, critically appraised, and summarized generic questionnaires assessing one or more aspects of the medicine use experience among adult patients using prescription medicines for chronic conditions, and the process of questionnaire development, degree of patient involvement, and/or validation processes.

Results
Fifteen questionnaires were included. Of these, nine measures were multidimensional, covering various aspects of medicine use. Six instruments covered only a single domain, assessing a specific facet of using medicines. Domains covered were the following: effectiveness; convenience, practicalities, and/or managing medicines; information, knowledge, and/or understanding; side effects; relationships and/or communication with health professionals; impact on daily living and/or social life; general satisfaction; attitudes; beliefs, concerns, and/or perceptions; medical follow-up and/or adherence-related issues; treatment- and/or medicine-related burden, perceived control, or autonomy; self-confidence about medicine use; availability and accessibility; and medicine-related quality of life. None of the identified questionnaires covered all domains. Instruments varied in the extent of patient involvement in both their development and validation.

Conclusion
There is a scarcity of psychometrically sound, comprehensive, and generic measures of experiences of using prescription medicines among adult patients living with chronic illnesses. There is a need for further development and/or validation of existing instruments suitable for use in this population.},

	doi = {10.2147/PPA.S112931},
	abstract = {Background
Services provided by community pharmacists designed to support people using medicines are increasing. In England, two national services exist: Medicine Use Reviews (MUR) and New Medicines Service (NMS). Very few studies have been conducted seeking views of the public, rather than service users, on willingness to use these services or expectations of these services, or determined whether views align with pharmacist perceptions.

Objective
To compare the perceptions of pharmacists and the general public on medicines-related services, particularly MUR and NMS services.

Methods
Two parallel surveys were conducted in one area of England: one involved the general public and was administered using a street survey, and the other was a postal survey of community pharmacists. Similar questionnaires were used, seeking views of services, awareness, reasons for using services, and perceived benefits.

Results
Response rates were 47.2\% (1,000/2,012 approached) for the public and 40.8\% (341/836) for pharmacists. Few people had experienced a discussion in a private consultation room or were aware of the two formal services, although their willingness to use them was high. Pharmacists estimated time spent on service provision as 10 minutes for MUR and 12 minutes for NMS, which aligned with acceptability to both pharmacists and the public. Pharmacists underestimated the willingness of the public to wait for an informal discussion or to make appointments for formal services. Both pharmacists and the public had high expectations that services would be beneficial in terms of increasing knowledge and understanding, but public expectations and experiences of services helping to sort out problems fell well below pharmacists’ perceptions. People who had experienced a pharmacy service had different perceptions of pharmacists.

Conclusion
Views differed regarding why people use services and key aspects of service delivery. For services to improve, the pharmacy profession needs a better awareness of what the public, especially those with potential to benefit from services, view as acceptable and desirable.},

These services may also offer ways of addressing the historic under-utilization of community pharmacists’ clinical skills and expertise. Medicines management services differ significantly from the dispensing and medicines sales roles traditionally associated with community pharmacy, particularly in relation to the provision for pharmacists to make recommendations to both patients and doctors about pharmacological treatment and lifestyle management. This paper describes patients’ experiences of a medicines management service provided by community pharmacists for people with coronary heart disease, delivered in England. It draws on findings from semistructured, face-to-face interviews with 49 patients recruited from pilot sites delivering the service. Findings suggest that although patients cautiously welcomed the opportunity to consult with a pharmacist about their medicines, they had reservations about them making recommendations about treatment, and many still regarded the doctor as the health professional ‘in charge’ of their medicines. The implications of these findings are discussed in light of the developing sociological literature on pharmacy and medicines usage.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
To investigate whether patients’ expectations influence how they take their medications by looking at the expectations patients have of their medications and the factors that affect these expectations.

DESIGN
Qualitative study using in-depth interviews and a grounded-theory approach.

SETTING
A large city in Ontario.

PARTICIPANTS
A total of 18 community-dwelling adult patients taking medication for at least 6 months.

METHOD
Both purposive and convenience sampling techniques were used. The initial strategy comprised stratified, maximum variation, and typical case sampling. The research team developed a semistructured interview guide after a preliminary review of the literature. Individual, face-to-face, in-depth interviews were conducted and audiotaped. At the end of the interviews, basic demographic information was collected. Interviewers were debriefed following each interview and their comments on relevant contextual information, general impressions of the interview, and possible changes to the interview guide were audiotaped. Audiotapes of each interview, including the debriefing, were transcribed verbatim, cleaned, and given a unique identifying number. At least 2 team members participated in analyzing the data using an operational code book that was modified to accommodate emerging themes as analysis continued.

MAIN FINDINGS
Patients’ expectations were more realistic than idealistic. Many participants acted on their expectations by changing their medication regimens on their own or by seeking additional information on their medications. Expectations were affected by patients’ beliefs, past experiences with medications, relationships with their health care providers, other people’s beliefs, and the cost of medication. Patients actively engaged in strategies to confirm or modify their expectations of their medications.

CONCLUSION
A range of factors (most notably past experiences with medications and relationships with health care providers) influenced patients’ expectations of their medications. More comprehensive discussion between patients and their health care providers about these factors could affect whether medications are used optimally.},

	abstract = {Non-adherence to medication is a ‘worldwide problem of striking magnitude’.1 It has consequences for the health of patients and is a great concern for healthcare providers in terms of patient outcomes and healthcare costs. Theoretical research has mainly focused on intentional non-adherence: for example, when people choose not to take their medication. However, unintentional non-adherence also accounts for a significant proportion of the problem: when people mean to take their medication in the right way but do not. This area is under-researched. In this paper, we bring a new perspective to this problem by exploring what contribution ‘resilience’ could make to it. Resilience engineering focuses on a system's ability to maintain performance, avoid error, compensate for poor circumstances and cope with disturbances. So, rather than focus on how things go wrong, we propose to exploit and enhance how things go right.

The National Health Service in England processed 962 million prescriptions in 2011, which had an ingredient cost of £8.8 billion,2 and it is estimated that 30\%–50\% of prescribed medication are not taken correctly.3 A report prepared for a summit of European health ministers in 2012 estimated that non-adherence contributes approximately 57\% of \$500 billion total avoidable costs attributed to suboptimal medicine use globally each year.4 Horne et al 3 provide a broad and comprehensive review of the research in this area. Their report shows that the problem is complex and multifaceted, and they call for more research to tackle this important issue. They argue that improving the effectiveness of adherence interventions could have a greater impact on public health than improvements in specific medical treatments.3

Haynes et al 5 note that current successful interventions for non-adherence are multifaceted, complex, labour intensive and at best have modest effects; they call for innovative approaches to assist …},

By opening up and rebalancing the discussion about medication, we can expect a consultation which is more satisfying for both parties and flowing from this, more effective, focused prescribing of medication which is more likely to be adhered to by the patient. We examine the extent to which doctor and patient behaviors are currently compatible with this change of concept and practice, look at available consultation models which might be useful to the reflective practitioner and consider what actions on the part of the doctor and the healthcare system could promote medicine prescription and utilization in line with this new approach based on partnership.},

	abstract = {We draw on a systematic review of research on two-way communication between patients and health practitioners about medicines in order to determine the extent to which concordance is, or is not, being put into practice. Six electronic databases were searched using the following categories of search terms: health care professionals, patients/consumers, medicine-taking/prescribing and communication. Articles were also identified from handsearches of journals, article reference lists and the Concordance website. Studies published between 1991 and 2000 were included. Studies were not excluded on the basis of design, methods or language employed. Abstracts of identified articles were assessed by at least two reviewers and the full articles were assessed by one reviewer and checked by at least one other reviewer. Data on the design, analysis and relevant findings were extracted. A total of 11 801 abstracts were reviewed and 470 full articles were retrieved. Of the 134 articles subsequently included, 116 were descriptive studies. All but 10 of the papers were written in English. There were mixed findings about the extent to which patients feel that their beliefs, experience and preferences about medicines can be shared. Doctors tend to dominate discussions in consultations, although patient participation is associated with positive outcomes. Health care professionals' behaviour can impede as well as enhance patient involvement. There is little research that examines fundamental issues for concordance such as whether an exchange of views takes place. It is possible that interventions are needed to facilitate the development of concordance in practice.},

Design Longitudinal cohort study.
Setting The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing waves 6 and 7.
Participants 5213 adults aged 60 or older.
Main outcome measures Rates, incidence rate ratio (IRR) and 95\% CI for falls in people with and without polypharmacy.
Results A total of 5213 participants contributed 10 502 person-years of follow-up, with a median follow-up of 2.02 years (IQR 1.9–2.1 years). Of the 1611 participants with polypharmacy, 569 reported at least one fall within the past 2 years (rate: 175 per 1000 person-years, 95\% CI 161 to 190), and of the 3602 participants without polypharmacy 875 reported at least one fall (rate: 121 per 1000 person-years, 95\% CI 113 to 129). The rate of falls was 21\% higher in people with polypharmacy compared with people without polypharmacy (adjusted IRR 1.21, 95\% CI 1.11 to 1.31). Using ≥4 drugs threshold the rate of falls was 18\% higher in people with polypharmacy compared with people without (adjusted IRR 1.18, 95\% CI 1.08 to 1.28), whereas using ≥10 drugs threshold polypharmacy was associated with a 50\% higher rate of falls (adjusted IRR 1.50, 95\% CI 1.34 to 1.67).
Conclusions We found almost one-third of the total population using five or more drugs, which was significantly associated with 21\% increased rate of falls over a 2-year period. Further exploration of the effects of these complex drug combinations in the real world with a detailed standardised assessment of polypharmacy is greatly required along with pragmatic studies in primary care, which will help inform whether the threshold for a detailed medication review should be lowered.},

	abstract = {Background
              In England in 2015/16, ambulance services responded to nearly 11 million calls. Ambulance Quality Indicators show that half of the patients receiving a response by telephone or face to face were not conveyed to an emergency department. A total of 11\% of patients received telephone advice only. A total of 38\% of patients were sent an ambulance but were not conveyed to an emergency department. For the 10 large ambulance services in England, rates of calls ending in telephone advice varied between 5\% and 17\%. Rates of patients who were sent an ambulance but not conveyed to an emergency department varied between 23\% and 51\%. Overall non-conveyance rates varied between 40\% and 68\%.
            
            
              Objective
              To explain variation in non-conveyance rates between ambulance services.
            
            
              Design
              A sequential mixed methods study with five work packages.
            
            
              Setting
              Ten of the 11 ambulance services serving {\textgreater} 99\% of the population of England.
            
            
              Methods
              (1) A qualitative interview study of managers and paramedics from each ambulance service, as well as ambulance commissioners (totalling 49 interviews undertaken in 2015). (2) An analysis of 1 month of routine data from each ambulance service (November 2014). (3) A qualitative study in three ambulance services with different published rates of calls ending in telephone advice (120 hours of observation and 20 interviews undertaken in 2016). (4) An analysis of routine data from one ambulance service linked to emergency department attendance, hospital admission and mortality data (6 months of 2013). (5) A substudy of non-conveyance for people calling 999 with breathing problems.
            
            
              Results
              Interviewees in the qualitative study identified factors that they perceived to affect non-conveyance rates. Where possible, these perceptions were tested using routine data. Some variation in non-conveyance rates between ambulance services was likely to be due to differences in the way rates were calculated by individual services, particularly in relation to telephone advice. Rates for the number of patients sent an ambulance but not conveyed to an emergency department were associated with patient-level factors: age, sex, deprivation, time of call, reason for call, urgency level and skill level of attending crew. However, variation between ambulance services remained after adjustment for patient-level factors. Variation was explained by ambulance service-level factors after adjustment for patient-level factors: the percentage of calls attended by advanced paramedics [odds ratio 1.05, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 1.07], the perception of ambulance service staff and commissioners that advanced paramedics were established and valued within the workforce of an ambulance service (odds ratio 1.84, 95\% CI 1.45 to 2.33), and the perception of ambulance service staff and commissioners that senior management was risk averse regarding non-conveyance within an ambulance service (odds ratio 0.78, 95\% CI 0.63 to 0.98).
            
            
              Limitations
              Routine data from ambulance services are complex and not consistently collected or analysed by ambulance services, thus limiting the utility of comparative analyses.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Variation in non-conveyance rates between ambulance services in England could be reduced by addressing variation in the types of paramedics attending calls, variation in how advanced paramedics are used and variation in perceptions of the risk associated with non-conveyance within ambulance service management. Linking routine ambulance data with emergency department attendance, hospital admission and mortality data for all ambulance services in the UK would allow comparison of the safety and appropriateness of their different non-conveyance rates.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experience-based design is an emerging method used to capture the emotional content of patient and family member healthcare experiences, and can serve as the foundation for patient-centered healthcare improvement. However, a core tool-the experience-based design questionnaire-requires words with consistent emotional meaning. Our objective was to identify and evaluate an emotion word set reliably categorized across the demographic spectrum as expressing positive, negative, or neutral emotions for experience-based design improvement work.
METHODS: We surveyed 407 patients, family members, and healthcare workers in 2011. Participants designated each of 67 potential emotion words as positive, neutral, or negative based on their emotional perception of the word. Overall agreement was assessed using the kappa statistic. Words were selected for retention in the final emotion word set based on 80\% simple agreement on classification of meaning across subgroups.
RESULTS: The participants were 47.9\% (195/407) patients, 19.4\% (33/407) family members and 32.7\% (133/407) healthcare staff. Overall agreement adjusted for chance was moderate (k=0.55). However, agreement for positive (k=0.69) and negative emotions (k=0.68) was substantially higher, while agreement in the neutral category was low (k=0.11). There were 20 positive, 1 neutral, and 14 negative words retained for the final experience-based design emotion word set.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a reliable set of emotion words for experience questionnaires to serve as the foundation for patient-centered, experience-based redesign of healthcare.
IMPLICATIONS: Incorporation of patient and family member perspectives in healthcare requires reliable tools to capture the emotional content of care touch points.},

Methods : Participants were 262 people aged 70 years or older with a fall-related ASNSW attendance who were not transported to an emergency department. They completed a questionnaire about health, medical and physical factors previously associated with falling. Falls were monitored for six months after ambulance attendance with monthly fall calendars. Results : Participants had a high prevalence of chronic medical conditions, functional limitations and past falls. During follow-up, 145 participants (58\%) experienced 488 falls. Significant predictors of falls during follow-up were three or more falls in the past year, being unable to walk more than 10 minutes without resting, and requiring assistance for personal-care activities of daily living (ADLs). Sixty-two participants (25\%) required repeat, fall-related ambulance attendance during the study. Predictors of repeat ambulance use were: 3+ falls in past year, requiring assistance for personal-care ADLs and having disabling pain in past month. Conclusions : Older, non-transported fallers seen by the ASNSW are a vulnerable population with high rates of chronic health conditions. Implications : Onward referral for preventive interventions may reduce future falls and ambulance service calls.},

Results: Twelve studies were included. Non-transportation rates following a fall ranged from 11\% to 56\%. Up to 49\% of non-transported people who have fallen had unplanned health-care contact within 28 days of the initial incident. Attendance by specially trained paramedics and individualised multifactorial interventions signiﬁcantly reduced adverse events including subsequent falls, emergency ambulance calls, emergency department attendance and hospital admission.
Conclusion: Limited but promising evidence shows that appropriate interventions can improve health outcomes of non-transported older people who have fallen. Further studies are needed to explore alternate care pathways and promote more efﬁcient use of health services.},

	abstract = {Background Falls represent an increasing source of geriatric morbidity and mortality. Prehospital emergency services may be uniquely suited to screen and refer subsets of high-risk older adults to fall prevention programmes. This systematic review assesses the effectiveness of such screening and referral programmes.
Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, the Cochrane Library and OTseeker for English-language peer-reviewed randomised trials, non-randomised trials and cohort studies evaluating prehospital fall risk screening and referral programmes for community-dwelling adults ≥60 years of age. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool. Primary outcomes included the risk and rate of falling. Secondary outcomes included successful follow-up to address fall risks and adverse events.
Results From 6187 unique records, 6 studies were included. Screening varied from using semistructured risk assessments to recording chief complaints. All studies were at high risk of bias. One unblinded trial of a multifactorial fall prevention programme demonstrated a 14.3\% (95\% CI 6.1\% to 22.5\%) absolute reduction in annual fall risk and a relative fall incidence of 0.45 (95\% CI 0.35 to 0.58). The probability of successful follow-up varied from 9.8\% to 81.0\%. No studies demonstrated any attributable adverse events.
Conclusions No high-quality evidence demonstrates that prehospital services reduce falls in communitydwelling older adults. Screening by prehospital personnel using semistructured risk assessments appears feasible, but it is unclear whether this is superior to referral based on fall-related chief complaints.

	abstract = {Background
With an increase in the proportion of older people in the community comes an increase in the demand on emergency medical services (EMS) by elderly patients who have fallen.
Objective
To describe the epidemiology of elderly falls patients attended by EMS in Victoria, Australia and identify predictors of transport and repeat falls.
Methods
A retrospective review included all elderly (age ≥ 65 years) falls patients attended by EMS between 2010 and 2017. Patient characteristics are described using descriptive statistics. Predictors of transport to hospital and repeat falls were identified using multivariable logistic regression analyses.
Results
Between 2010 and 2017 EMS attended 324,060 elderly falls patients, which represents 9.7\% of EMS attended workload in Victoria. The median age of patients was 83 years (IQR: 76–88) and 60.2\% were female. Comorbidities and medication use were common, while private residence (64.3\%) and nursing home (20.0\%) were common scene locations. Overall, 78.8\% of falls events resulted in transport to hospital by EMS. Predictors of transport to hospital included female gender, one or more pre-existing medical conditions or current medications and meeting the pre-hospital trauma triage criteria or hospital major trauma criteria. To investigate predictors of repeat falls, the follow-up period was restricted to 12-months post initial fall, which resulted in 30,997 patients and 42,873 (13.2\%) repeat fall incidents. The median number of days between the initial fall and a second fall was 98 (IQR: 27–206). Predictors of repeat falls included living at a nursing home, one or more pre-existing medical conditions and one or more current medications.
Conclusions
Older falls patients place significant demand on EMS resources in Victoria, Australia, accounting for 9.7\% of EMS attendances. Despite high demand, just 3.8\% of elderly falls patients received a ‘lights and sirens’ emergency transport response to hospital. Furthermore, a large number of falls incidents recorded during the study period were repeat falls. Access to alternative pathways of care like GP referral, allied and community health services may benefit this patient group. Development and enrolment into such programs may improve patient outcomes by minimising falls risk and decrease demand on EMS and hospital resources.},

	abstract = {Objective To evaluate whether a service to prevent falls in the community would help reduce the rate of falls in older people who call an emergency ambulance when they fall but are not taken to hospital.
Design Randomised controlled trial.
Setting Community covered by four primary care trusts, England.
Participants 204 adults aged more than 60 living at home or in residential care who had fallen and called an emergency ambulance but were not taken to hospital.
Interventions Referral to community fall prevention services or standard medical and social care.
Main outcome measures The primary outcome was the rate of falls over 12 months, ascertained from monthly diaries. Secondary outcomes were scores on the Barthel index, Nottingham extended activities of daily living scale, and falls efficacy scale at baseline and by postal questionnaire at 12 months. Analysis was by intention to treat.
Results 102 people were allocated to each group. 99 (97\%) participants in the intervention group received the intervention. Falls diaries were analysed for 88.6 person years in the intervention group and 84.5 person years in the control group. The incidence rates of falls per year were 3.46 in the intervention group and 7.68 in the control group (incidence rate ratio 0.45, 95\% confidence interval 0.35 to 0.58, P{\textless}0.001). The intervention group achieved higher scores on the Barthel index and Nottingham extended activities of daily living and lower scores on the falls efficacy scale (all P{\textless}0.05) at the 12 month follow-up. The number of times an emergency ambulance was called because of a fall was significantly different during follow-up (incidence rate ratio 0.60, 95\% confidence interval 0.40 to 0.92, P=0.018).
Conclusion A service to prevent falls in the community reduced the fall rate and improved clinical outcome in the high risk group of older people who call an emergency ambulance after a fall but are not taken to hospital.

	abstract = {Study objective
We aim to determine clinical and cost-effectiveness of a paramedic protocol for the care of older people who fall.
Methods
We undertook a cluster randomized trial in 3 UK ambulance services between March 2011 and June 2012. We included patients aged 65 years or older after an emergency call for a fall, attended by paramedics based at trial stations. Intervention paramedics could refer the patient to a community-based falls service instead of transporting the patient to the emergency department. Control paramedics provided care as usual. The primary outcome was subsequent emergency contacts or death.
Results
One hundred five paramedics based at 14 intervention stations attended 3,073 eligible patients; 110 paramedics based at 11 control stations attended 2,841 eligible patients. We analyzed primary outcomes for 2,391 intervention and 2,264 control patients. One third of patients made further emergency contacts or died within 1 month, and two thirds within 6 months, with no difference between groups. Subsequent 999 call rates within 6 months were lower in the intervention arm (0.0125 versus 0.0172; adjusted difference –0.0045; 95\% confidence interval –0.0073 to –0.0017). Intervention paramedics referred 8\% of patients (204/2,420) to falls services and left fewer patients at the scene without any ongoing care. Intervention patients reported higher satisfaction with interpersonal aspects of care. There were no other differences between groups. Mean intervention cost was \$23 per patient, with no difference in overall resource use between groups at 1 or 6 months.
Conclusion
A clinical protocol for paramedics reduced emergency ambulance calls for patients attended for a fall safely and at modest cost.},
